# Azure Resource Creation using Terraform

This repository contains Terraform configurations for creating and managing Azure resources.  This is a template, and you'll need to customize it to your specific needs.

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure Subscription:** You need an active Azure subscription.
2. **Azure CLI:** The Azure CLI is required to authenticate with Azure.  Ensure it's installed and configured.  See [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?pivots=platform-linux) for instructions.
3. **Terraform:**  Install Terraform.  Download from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
4. **Azure Provider:** Ensure the Azure provider is installed and configured for Terraform.  You can usually install the provider using: `terraform init`

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Navigate to the directory:** `cd <repository_directory>`
3. **Authenticate with Azure:**  Use the Azure CLI to login: `az login`
4. **Configure Terraform:**  You will need to configure Terraform with your Azure credentials.  This is typically done through environment variables or a `~/.azure/credentials` file. Refer to Azure's documentation on authentication methods.   Example:
   ```bash
   export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<your_client_id>"
   export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="<your_client_secret>"
   export AZURE_TENANT_ID="<your_tenant_id>"
   export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your_subscription_id>"
   ```
5. **Initialize Terraform:** `terraform init` This will download the necessary Azure provider plugins.
6. **Plan the changes:** `terraform plan` This will show you what resources will be created or modified.
7. **Apply the changes:** `terraform apply` This will create the resources in your Azure subscription.
8. **Destroy the resources:**  When you're finished, use `terraform destroy` to delete all the created resources.  **Use this command with caution!**

## Configuration Files

This repository will typically contain one or more `.tf` (Terraform) files.  These files define the infrastructure you want to create.  You'll find examples of creating:


* **Resource Groups:**  Containers for your Azure resources.
* **Virtual Networks:**  Private networks for your VMs.
* **Virtual Machines:** Compute instances.
* **Storage Accounts:** Storage for your data.
* **And more...**


## Customization

You'll need to customize the Terraform configuration files to match your specific requirements.  Pay close attention to the variables defined within the files to adjust settings such as:

* **Resource Names:** Use descriptive and unique names for your resources.
* **Locations:** Specify the Azure region where your resources should be created.
* **Resource Sizes:** Choose appropriate sizes for your VMs and other resources.
